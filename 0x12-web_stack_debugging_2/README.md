# Web stack debugging #2


Moses Muchai, a DevOps Engineer at 0x12, participated in the Web Stack Debugging #2 project, which was part of a series of debugging tasks involving broken web stacks in isolated containers.
In this project, he was responsible for rectifying the issues within the web stack to restore functionality. For each task, Muchai devised scripts to automate the necessary commands for fixing the web stack.
The tasks included running software as another user, ensuring Nginx ran correctly on port 8080 under the designated user 'nginx', and creating a bash script containing seven lines or less to achieve the same outcome.
These tasks demanded meticulous debugging skills and scripting expertise, which Muchai applied to successfully resolve the issues and optimize the web stack's performance.
