0x0B. SSH DevOps SSH Network SysAdmin Security Cohort

In this project led by Moses Muchai, the focus is on SSH (Secure Shell) and its essential role in connecting to remote servers securely.
Users are tasked with creating and utilizing SSH key pairs, configuring SSH client files, and implementing Puppet for client configuration changes.
I emphasize on the significance of understanding servers, their locations, and the SSH protocol. The tasks involve creating an RSA key pair, configuring
SSH client files for key-based authentication, and using Puppet for SSH client configuration changes. The ultimate goal is to enable secure and passwordless
connections to an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server.
