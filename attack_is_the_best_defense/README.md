Attack is the best defense DevOps Scripting Hacking Cohort

In the "Attack is the Best Defense" project, I Moses Muchai introduces essential tools like Wireshark, Telnet, Tcpdump, Docker, and Hydra to delve into network security.
The focus is on the "0-0-sniffing" task, where the project explains the concept of network security and the potential risks associated with unencrypted communication.
It highlights the importance of securing sensitive information transmitted over networks, cautioning against malicious interception by attackers. The project emphasizes
the vulnerability of legacy systems, particularly Telnet, to unauthorized access. Practical exercises involve sniffing unencrypted traffic using Tcpdump and analyzing it
to extract information. A real-world scenario involves using Sendgrid for email services, showcasing the project's hands-on approach to understanding and addressing network
security threats.
