0x16. API advanced Python Scripting Back-end API Cohort

0x16. API Advanced
Description
This project focuses on advanced API handling using Python scripting for back-end development. It is part of the SE Foundations curriculum, with a weight of 1. The project commenced on March 4, 2024, at 7:00 PM, and concluded on March 5, 2024, at 7:00 PM. The checker was released at March 5, 2024, 1:00 AM, with an auto-review scheduled at the deadline.

Background Context
API-related questions are common in technical interviews, ranging from simple Python scripting tasks to more complex challenges involving recursion and data manipulation. The project encourages practice with APIs, specifically recommending the Reddit API due to its extensive endpoints and accessible information. Understanding API calls, pagination, JSON parsing, recursion, and dictionary sorting is crucial for technical interviews and personal projects alike.

Resources
Reddit API Documentation
Query String
