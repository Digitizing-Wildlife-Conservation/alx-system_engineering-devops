0x10. HTTPS SSL DevOps SysAdmin Security Cohort

In this project, I gained an understanding of the significance of HTTPS and its implementation. To enhance the security of my HolbertonBnB web servers,
I utilized the certbot certificate and implemented HAproxy SSL termination. The tasks included the creation of a Bash script, 0-world_wide_web, which
provides information about subdomains on the configured servers. The script allows users to specify a domain and subdomain, displaying relevant details.
Additionally, I configured HAproxy in the 1-haproxy_ssl_termination task to accept encrypted SSL traffic for the subdomain www. on TCP port 443. In the
subsequent task, 100-redirect_http_to_https, I ensured that there are no loopholes in website traffic by creating an HAproxy configuration file that 
automatically redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS. These tasks collectively contribute to the overall security and proper functioning of the web servers.
