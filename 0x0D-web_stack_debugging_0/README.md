0x0D. Web stack debugging #0 DevOps SysAdmin Scripting Debugging Cohort

By: Moses Muchai

In this debugging project, We students are tasked with resolving issues in a web stack, emphasizing the importance of practice in mastering debugging skills.
Broken web stacks are provided, and the goal is to create a Bash script that, when executed, brings the web stack to a working state. The initial task involves
fixing a server by ensuring it has a copy of the /etc/passwd file in /tmp and a file named /tmp/isworking containing the string "OK."

The provided example demonstrates the manual process of fixing the server using Docker commands and then creating a Bash script to automate the solution.
The tasks also include installing Docker and testing the solution within a container. The project enforces coding standards, such as using allowed editors, 
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, proper file endings, executable Bash scripts, passing Shellcheck without errors, and providing comments in scripts.

The project covers key concepts like network basics, Docker, and web stack debugging. It provides a non-exhaustive guide to debugging, including testing and 
verifying assumptions and obtaining a quick overview of the machine state using commands like w, history, top, df, and netstat. The debugging process is explained
at the machine, network, and process levels, addressing issues related to disk space, CPU load, memory, disk IO, network interfaces, listening sockets, firewall rules,
and software processes.

Overall, the project aims to instill effective debugging practices and methodologies, acknowledging that debugging is a challenging but essential aspect of a software engineer's role.
