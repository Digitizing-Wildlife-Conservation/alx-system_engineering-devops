Web Stack Debugging #1
Overview
In this project, we dive into web stack debugging, focusing on network basics and troubleshooting issues related to Nginx installation. The primary goal is to ensure that Nginx is running and listening on port 80 of all active IPv4 IPs. The provided tasks involve identifying and fixing the problem, with specific requirements for the Bash scripts.

Task 0: Nginx Likes Port 80
For the initial task, the challenge is to find and resolve issues preventing the Ubuntu container's Nginx installation from listening on port 80. A Bash script, named 0-nginx_likes_port_80, is created to automate the fix. The script ensures Nginx is running and configured to listen on port 80.

Task 1: Make It Sweet and Short
Building on the first task, the goal here is to create a concise Bash script, 1-debugging_made_short, that addresses the same issue with brevity. The script is limited to 5 lines, adheres to standard Bash script requirements, and uses a service (init) to confirm that Nginx is not running.
