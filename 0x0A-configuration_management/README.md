In my experience at this project , By Moses Muchai I  share a crucial lesson about the importance of configuration management.
While working on an auto-remediation tool called Skynet, a bug in my code caused a significant issue: 75% of the conversion
infrastructure servers were unintentionally shut down, disrupting user activities. Thanks to Puppet, the team was able to restore
the infrastructure efficiently within an hour. Moses emphasizes the value of investing time and energy in writing Puppet code for 
infrastructure, highlighting its role in automation and rapid recovery from unforeseen issues. This story underscores the significance
of configuration management tools like Puppet in maintaining stable and resilient systems.
