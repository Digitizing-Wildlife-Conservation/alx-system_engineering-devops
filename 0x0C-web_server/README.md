0x0C. Web server DevOps SysAdmin in this project,I Moses Muchai introduces the concept of a web server and emphasizes the importance of automating tasks for Software Engineers.
The primary focus is on configuring a web server according to specified requirements using a Bash script. The concept of a child process is also explored,
highlighting the significance of automating work to efficiently manage multiple servers. The project includes quiz questions covering topics such as DNS,
web server roles, HTTP requests, and child processes. Learning objectives involve understanding the main role of a web server, the purpose of DNS, and 
various DNS record types. The provided tasks require creating a Bash script to transfer files to a server using SCP, reinforcing the automation principle.
The project aims to enhance students' knowledge of web servers, DNS, and automation while providing practical tasks to demonstrate their skills.

A child process, in the context of Unix or Linux dedicated servers, is a process created by another process, referred to as the "parent process." Child processes
provide the advantage of being able to start or stop independently of the parent process, enhancing flexibility. However, they are typically reliant on the parent process,
and if the parent process terminates, the child process becomes an orphan. In server operations, the kernel and programs like Apache may initiate child processes to handle
tasks such as managing web page accesses. For example, Apache generates child processes when the number of user requests exceeds the allowed maximum. The command "ps axf" 
can be used to view all running processes, including their child processes, in a tree format. This mechanism allows for efficient resource management and scalability in server environments.

Web server 

A web server is software or hardware that receives and responds to requests from clients over the internet, delivering web content and facilitating communication using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).



In this project, tasks are evaluated based on two criteria: first, whether the web-01 server is configured according to specified requirements, and second, if the provided answer file contains a Bash script capable
of automatically executing commands to configure an Ubuntu machine without human intervention. The emphasis is on automation to streamline server management, highlighting the importance of scripting to perform tasks efficiently.
An illustrative example involves creating a file, /tmp/test, with specific content and modifying the Nginx configuration to listen on port 8080. The objective is to train participants in automating tasks to avoid manual repetition,
particularly beneficial for System Reliability Engineers (SREs) managing numerous servers. It's noteworthy that the checker will execute scripts as the root user, eliminating the need for the sudo command.

A good Software Engineer is a lazy Software Engineer

The statement "A good Software Engineer is a lazy Software Engineer" implies that an effective software engineer seeks efficiency and automation, aiming to minimize manual effort by automating repetitive tasks.
It encourages engineers to develop scripts and processes that can handle routine operations, allowing them to focus on more complex and intellectually challenging aspects of their work. The provided tips suggest
testing Bash scripts in a reproducible environment, such as an Ubuntu 16.04 Docker container, to ensure the scripts behave as expected. This aligns with the idea of using automation tools, like Docker, to streamline
the testing and deployment processes in software development.


The article argues that the best programmers often exhibit traits that may seem undesirable—being lazy and acting dumb. Laziness, in this context, is seen positively as it drives programmers to automate tasks and avoid redundant,
monotonous code. Lazy programmers seek efficient solutions and contribute to tools and processes that streamline productivity. They are keen on avoiding unnecessary work and favor existing, tested solutions from the open-source community.

The concept of acting dumb is about maintaining a humble and open mindset. Programmers who don't act overly smart are more likely to continue learning, be critical of their work, and embrace simple, unconventional approaches to 
problem-solving. This approach encourages asking basic questions and staying open to discovering better solutions. The article contends that these seemingly negative traits—laziness and acting dumb—can lead to improved productivity
and constant growth in programming skills.


The "Resources" section lists essential materials for the project, covering various topics related to web development and server management. It recommends reading or watching resources on fundamental subjects like "How the web works,
" "Nginx," and "How to Configure Nginx." Additionally, it suggests learning about concepts such as child processes, root and subdomains, HTTP requests, HTTP redirection, and the "Not found" HTTP response code. Understanding Linux log
files is also emphasized.

For reference, the section includes two RFCs (Request for Comments): RFC 7231 for HTTP/1.1 and RFC 7540 for HTTP/2. The "man" or "help" command references provide guidance on the usage of essential command-line tools like scp and curl.
These resources are intended to equip learners with the knowledge needed to successfully complete the project tasks related to web server configuration and automation.
