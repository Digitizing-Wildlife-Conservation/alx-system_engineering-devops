0x14. MySQL DevOps SysAdmin MySQL Cohort

The project titled "MySQL DevOps SysAdmin MySQL Cohort" was undertaken by Moses Muchai, a DevOps Engineer. It involves configuring database servers in a primary-replica model and automating database backups using Bash scripting.
The tasks undertaken included:

Configuration of the primary MySQL database server named tyrell_corp, using the my.conf configuration file provided in the directory 4-mysql_configuration_primary.

Configuration of the replica MySQL database server also named tyrell_corp, using a separate my.conf configuration file provided in the directory 4-mysql_configuration_replica.

Development of a Bash script named 5-mysql_backup to automate the generation of compressed tar.gz archive backups from a MySQL dump. The script requires the MySQL root password
as input and generates a dump containing all MySQL databases on the root server. The resulting tar archive is named in the format day-month-year.tar.gz.

Overall, Moses Muchai, as a DevOps Engineer, focused on setting up a MySQL primary-replica setup and creating a reliable backup solution for database management.
