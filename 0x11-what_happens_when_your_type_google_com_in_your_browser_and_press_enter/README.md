In this project, the individual, identified as a Fullstack Software Engineer, undertook the task of elucidating the intricacies of the web 2.0 infrastructure, an endeavor crucial to their professional role.
The primary focus was on addressing the common interview question, "What happens when you type a URL into a browser and hit 'Enter'?" The resulting blog post, stored in the 0-blog_post directory, delves into
the sequential processes encompassing DNS request, TCP/IP, firewall traversal, HTTPS/SSL encryption, load balancing, web server interaction, application server functionality, and database engagement.
The requirements for the blog post were comprehensively met, emphasizing the importance of understanding DNS and positioning the project as a means to showcase proficiency to potential employers. Additionally,
a visual representation of the request flow was constructed in the 1-what_happen_when_diagram directory, accessible through the provided link. The diagram elucidates DNS resolution, server interaction, encryption,
firewall traversal, load balancing distribution, web server response, application server operation, and database interaction. Overall, the project demonstrates a systematic exploration of the web stack's functioning
atop the internet, offering a valuable resource for both interview preparation and professional visibility.
